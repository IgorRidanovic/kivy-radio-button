# kivy-radio-button
Improved radio button functionality.

Kivy radio buttons are created by grouping multiple checkboxes or toggle buttons.

The default behavior allows for all radio buttons to be deselected. This is inconsistent with typical radio button operation. This code forces the last selected button to remain engaged ("down" position) until another radio button is pressed.
